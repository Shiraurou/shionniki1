            <h2>As an Ogre, Shion had a wild appearance with a thick black horn protruding from the center of her forehead and a small fang like tooth coming out of her mouth, the base of which had skin folded in a way where she appeared to be angry. She had large purple eyes and light purple hair tied into a ponytail, as well as a noticeably curvaceous figure with massive breasts. Her outfit consisted of a brown robe with thick woolen borders and a collar that revealed much of her cleavage. She also wore a necklace with a green stone in the center, between two white stones that looked like teeth, which in turn were also between two other green stones.</h2>

                <H2>In the anime, her skin had a purple tint matching her purple color scheme, as well as a sharp tooth peeking out from the corner of her mouth.</h2>

            <h1>KIJIN</h1>
            <h2>Similar to the evolution of her brethren, Shion's horn became narrower and she overall lost her vicious appearance in her transition to a Kijin as she no longer has a fang like tooth sticking out. She became a beautiful woman with a slender and voluptuous body, reaching a height of 170 centimeters. Her hair grew much longer, and her skin also lost its purple tint. In some instances of the Anime she has two fang like teeth in her mouth when speaking.</h2>

                <h2>She received a custom set of Western formal attire from Shuna; a purple business suit and light green shirt. She leaves the jacket unbuttoned, allowing a generous portion of her cleavage to spill out.</h2>
                
                <h2>Her appearance mostly remains the same for her subsequent evolutions.</h2>
